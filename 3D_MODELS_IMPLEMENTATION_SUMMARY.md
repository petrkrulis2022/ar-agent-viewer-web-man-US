# AR Viewer 3D Models Implementation Summary

## Date

October 24, 2025

## Branch

`revolut-qr-payments-sim`

## Overview

Successfully implemented professional 3D GLB models for all agents in the AR Viewer, replacing primitive geometric shapes with realistic 3D models from Sketchfab.

## Changes Made

### 1. 3D Models Added

Location: `/public/models/terminals/`

**Humanoid Robot Face** (`humanoid_robot_face.glb`)

- **Used For**: All non-payment terminal agents
- **Agent Types**:
  - intelligent_assistant
  - local_services
  - game_agent
  - content_creator
  - home_security
  - real_estate_broker
  - bus_stop_agent
  - tutor_teacher
  - study_buddy
  - my_ghost
  - world_builder_3d
  - And all other agent types

**Payment Terminal Device** (`pax-a920_highpoly.glb`)

- **Used For**: Payment terminal agents only
- **Agent Types**:
  - payment_terminal
  - trailing_payment_terminal

### 2. Code Changes

#### File: `src/components/Enhanced3DAgent.jsx`

**Added Imports:**

```jsx
import { useGLTF } from "@react-three/drei";
```

**Added Model Preloading:**

```jsx
useGLTF.preload("/models/terminals/humanoid_robot_face.glb");
useGLTF.preload("/models/terminals/pax-a920_highpoly.glb");
```

**Added Model Components:**

- `RoboticFaceModel` - Renders humanoid robot face for regular agents
- `PaymentTerminalModel` - Renders PAX A920 payment terminal for payment agents

**Updated `getEnhanced3DModel` Function:**

- Replaced all complex switch-case geometry logic with simple GLB model loading
- Added intelligent type detection for payment terminals
- Supports both `agent_type` and `object_type` fields (backward compatibility)
- Added ambient lighting and particle effects for enhanced visuals
- Maintained hover animations and glow effects

## Agent Type Mapping

### Payment Terminal Model (PAX A920)

```javascript
agent_type === "payment_terminal" ||
  agent_type === "trailing_payment_terminal" ||
  agent_type === "Payment Terminal" ||
  agent_type === "Trailing Payment Terminal" ||
  object_type === "payment_terminal" ||
  object_type === "trailing_payment_terminal";
```

### Robotic Face Model (All Others)

- All agent types not matching payment terminal conditions
- Includes legacy types and new AgentSphere types

## Visual Enhancements

### Both Model Types Include:

1. **Rotation Animation**: Smooth Y-axis spinning (controlled by `spinSpeed`)
2. **Floating Animation**: Gentle up/down movement for AR realism
3. **Hover Effects**:
   - Scale pulse animation
   - Enhanced particle effects
   - Increased glow intensity
4. **Distance-based Scaling**: Closer agents appear larger
5. **Ambient Lighting**: Point lights with agent-specific colors

### Payment Terminal Specific:

- Orange glow (#ffa500)
- 8 orbiting payment indicator particles when hovered
- Enhanced intensity for payment attention

### Robotic Face Specific:

- Agent-type specific colored glow
- 6 orbiting data particles when hovered
- Reflects agent personality through color

## Technical Implementation

### Model Loading

- Using `useGLTF` hook from `@react-three/drei`
- Models preloaded on component mount for better performance
- Scene cloning ensures each agent instance is independent

### Model Scales

- **Robotic Face**: 0.5 scale (adjustable)
- **Payment Terminal**: 0.6 scale (adjustable)
- Both scales can be fine-tuned based on actual model sizes

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Preloading**: Models loaded once and cached
2. **Cloning**: Efficient reuse of loaded geometry
3. **LOD Ready**: Distance-based scaling already implemented
4. **Particle Limits**: Hover effects use minimal geometry

## Backend Alignment

This implementation aligns with the AgentSphere backend which:

- Uses the same GLB model files
- Applies the same `object_type` mapping logic
- Maintains visual consistency across platforms

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Models successfully uploaded to `/public/models/terminals/`
- [x] `useGLTF` hook imported and configured
- [x] Model components created (RoboticFaceModel, PaymentTerminalModel)
- [x] Agent type detection logic implemented
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained (agent_type + object_type)
- [x] Hover animations preserved
- [x] Particle effects added
- [x] Console logging added for debugging
- [ ] Browser test - models load without errors
- [ ] Visual test - correct models appear for each agent type
- [ ] Performance test - smooth rendering with multiple agents
- [ ] AR test - models appear correctly in AR mode on mobile

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Browser**:

   - Start dev server on port 5173
   - Check browser console for GLB loading errors
   - Verify correct models render for payment vs non-payment agents

2. **Adjust Scales** (if needed):

   - If models too large: reduce scale values (0.3, 0.4, etc.)
   - If models too small: increase scale values (0.7, 0.8, etc.)

3. **Test Payment Flow**:

   - Verify payment terminals display PAX A920 model
   - Check $162, $528, $6.50 fees still work correctly
   - Ensure QR codes and virtual cards function

4. **Mobile AR Testing**:
   - Test on actual mobile device in AR mode
   - Verify models appear correctly in camera view
   - Check interaction (tap to pay) still works

## Fallback Strategy

If GLB models fail to load:

- Console will show error messages
- Component will attempt to render primitive geometry
- User experience degrades gracefully

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/Enhanced3DAgent.jsx` - Core rendering component
2. `/public/models/terminals/humanoid_robot_face.glb` - New file
3. `/public/models/terminals/pax-a920_highpoly.glb` - New file

## Dependencies

All required packages already installed:

- `@react-three/drei@^10.6.1` âœ…
- `@react-three/fiber@^9.2.0` âœ…
- `three` (peer dependency) âœ…

## Debugging

### Console Logs Added

```javascript
console.log(`ðŸ¤– Enhanced3DAgent rendering for ${agent.name}:`, {
  agent_type: agent.agent_type,
  object_type: agent.object_type,
  isPaymentTerminal,
  willUseModel: isPaymentTerminal ? "pax-a920_highpoly" : "humanoid_robot_face",
});
```

### Check for Issues:

1. Browser console for 404 errors (model not found)
2. Console logs showing which model is being used
3. Three.js warnings about geometry/materials
4. Performance metrics (FPS drop indicates optimization needed)

## Model File Sizes

- `humanoid_robot_face.glb`: ~2.9 MB (estimated)
- `pax-a920_highpoly.glb`: ~4.7 MB (estimated)
- **Total**: ~7.6 MB additional assets

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Implementation Complete** when:

1. Payment terminals show PAX A920 device model
2. All other agents show humanoid robot face model
3. Models rotate and animate smoothly
4. Hover effects work (particles appear)
5. Payment flows still function correctly
6. Performance remains acceptable (>30 FPS)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 src/components/Enhanced3DAgent.jsx
```

This will restore the previous primitive geometry version while keeping all other hackathon changes intact.

**Status**: âœ… Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing
**Next Action**: Start dev servers and test in browser
