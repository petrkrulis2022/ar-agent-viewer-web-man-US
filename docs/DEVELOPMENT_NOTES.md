## Recent Critical Fixes (August 2025) üîß

### ‚úÖ Database Connection Resolution

**Issue**: Marketplace showing only 3 mock agents instead of 56 real database agents  
**Root Cause**: `isSupabaseConfigured()` failing in browser environment, causing fallback to mock data  
**Solution**: Enhanced `useDatabase.js` to attempt Supabase queries regardless of configuration check  
**Result**: All 56 real agents now load successfully with complete wallet and token information

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Schema Integration

**Achievement**: Complete support for enhanced AgentSphere database schema  
**New Fields**:

- `deployer_wallet_address`, `payment_recipient_address`, `agent_wallet_address`
- `token_address`, `token_symbol`, `interaction_fee`
- `text_chat`, `voice_chat`, `video_chat` capabilities
- `mcp_services` for Model Context Protocol integration
- `features` for extended agent capabilities

### ‚úÖ Location & Coverage Improvements

**Enhancement**: Expanded location radius from 50km to 100km for global agent coverage  
**Integration**: RTK location service with GPS detection and intelligent fallbacks  
**Result**: Users can now discover agents regardless of their geographic location
