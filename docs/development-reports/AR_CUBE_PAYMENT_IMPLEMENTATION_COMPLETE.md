### 🔗 **6. AgentSphere Database Integration**

#### **Payment Configuration Reader**:

```javascript
getAgentPaymentConfig(agentId); // Reads from deployed_objects table
```

#### **Dynamic Method Loading**:

- Reads `payment_methods` JSONB field from AgentSphere
- Reads `payment_config` JSONB field for method-specific settings
- Reads wallet addresses and recipient addresses
- Dynamically shows/hides cube faces based on merchant configuration

#### **Real-time Status Indicator**:

- Green "✅ AgentSphere Connected" badge when database config loaded
- Graceful fallback to default methods if database unavailable

### 🖥️ **7. Crypto QR Payment Integration**

#### **Seamless QR Transition**:

- Smooth animation from cube to QR code display

- "Back to Cube" button for easy navigation
- Real-time payment status monitoring

#### **Multi-Blockchain Support**:

- **Primary**: Morph Network (USDT payments)
- **Secondary**: Solana, Hedera, Ethereum networks
- Uses existing payment services (morphPaymentService, etc.)

### 🎯 **8. Complete Payment Flow Integration**

#### **CameraView Integration**:

- Updated `handlePaymentRequest` to launch cube instead of old modal
- Proper camera stop/start management
- Cube payment completion handler with camera restart

#### **AR3DScene Integration**:
