## üîç Phase 5: Agent Filtering System

### Comprehensive Filtering Implementation

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

#### Filter Categories

**Primary Filters:**

- ‚úÖ All agents (default)
- ‚úÖ No Agents

**User-Based Filters:**

- ‚úÖ My agents (owned by connected wallet)
- ‚úÖ My Payment terminals (owned terminals only)
- ‚úÖ All non-my agents (others' agents)
- ‚úÖ All payment terminals (all terminals regardless of owner)

**Individual Agent Type Filters (11 types):**

1. ‚úÖ Intelligent Assistant
2. ‚úÖ Local Services
3. ‚úÖ Payment Terminal
4. ‚úÖ Game Agent
5. ‚úÖ 3D World Builder
6. ‚úÖ Home Security
7. ‚úÖ Content Creator
8. ‚úÖ Real Estate Broker
9. ‚úÖ Bus Stop Agent
10. ‚úÖ Trailing Payment Terminal
11. ‚úÖ My Ghost

#### Technical Features

**Filter Logic:**

- Mutual exclusivity between primary filters
- User-based filters override type filters
- Multiple type filters can be active simultaneously
- Real-time filtering as selections change
- Filter state persists during session

**Wallet Integration:**

- Filters match `agent_wallet_address` field in database
- Also checks `owner_wallet` as fallback
- Case-insensitive address comparison
- Supports EVM, Solana, and Hedera wallets

**Agent Type Normalization:**

- Database uses underscores: `payment_terminal`, `intelligent_assistant`
- Filter logic converts to spaces: `payment terminal`, `intelligent assistant`
- Automatic normalization via `.replace(/_/g, ' ')`
- Type matching is case-insensitive

**UI Implementation:**

- Reorganized info tiles: 3 tiles on left (Agents, Database, Camera)
- New "Filter Agents" tile on right side
- Checkbox-based selection
- Visual feedback for active filters
- Filtered agent count display

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/ARViewer.jsx` - Complete filtering system

---

## üîå Phase 6: Wallet Connection & Auto-Detection

### Wallet Integration Fixes

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

#### Issues Resolved

**1. Wallet Connection Structure**

- **Problem:** ARViewer expected `walletConnection.address` but received nested structure
- **Solution:** Updated to support `walletConnection.evm.address`
- **Fallback:** Also checks `solana.address`, `hedera.address`, and legacy `.address`

**2. Network Detection Compatibility**

- **Problem:** Some wallets don't support `eth_chainId` method
- **Error:** `Request method eth_chainId is not supported`
- **Solution:** Implemented fallback to `net_version` method
- **Graceful Degradation:** Returns "Unknown Network" if both fail

**3. Auto-Detection on AR View Load**

- **Feature:** Automatically detects already-connected MetaMask wallet
- **Implementation:** Checks `eth_accounts` on component mount
- **Benefit:** Users don't need to reconnect wallet in AR view
- **Scope:** Works with EVM wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)

**4. Error Handling**

- Balance fetching failures don't block connection
- Network detection failures don't prevent wallet connection
- User-friendly error messages with alerts
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/ARViewer.jsx` - Auto-detection logic
- `src/components/UnifiedWalletConnect.jsx` - Improved error handling
- `src/services/networkDetectionService.js` - Fallback methods

---
