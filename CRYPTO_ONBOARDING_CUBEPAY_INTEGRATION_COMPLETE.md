- ✅ Wired `onSwitchToCubePay` callback
- ✅ Fixed error handling to show choice even on API errors

#### `src/components/CryptoOnboardingModal.jsx`

- ✅ Added `onSwitchToCubePay` prop
- ✅ Passed callback to OnrampPurchaseFlow
- ✅ Maintained existing Coinbase Pay flow

#### `src/components/CubePaymentEngine.jsx`

- ✅ Implemented `onSwitchToCubePay` handler
- ✅ Closes crypto modal when CubePay selected
- ✅ Sends `switchToCubePay: true` flag to parent

#### `src/components/CameraView.jsx`

- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing flows

#### `src/pages/TestCryptoOnboarding.jsx`

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Payment Method Detection

```javascript
const handleCubePaymentComplete = (agent, paymentData) => {
  // Check if user switched to CubePay terminal
  if (paymentData?.switchToCubePay) {
    console.log("🔒 Opening CubePay terminal for private payment...");
    setShowCubePayment(false);
    setShowPaymentModal(true); // Opens CubePay terminal
    setSelectedAgent(agent);
    return;
  }

  // Handle normal Coinbase Pay completion
  // ...
};
```

### Choice Screen Logic

- Step flow: `preparing` → `choice` → `ready` → `purchasing`
- Choice screen shows before Coinbase API call
- Both buttons always visible, even if Coinbase API fails
- Green CubePay button calls `onSwitchToCubePay()` callback

### Error Handling

```javascript
catch (error) {
  console.error("❌ Failed to prepare onramp:", error);
  setError(error.message);
  setStep("choice"); // Always return to choice (not "ready")
  setLoading(false);
}
```

## 🎨 UI Design

### Choice Screen Features

- Dark gradient background matching app theme
- Amount display at top (e.g., "3 USDC")
- Two large, equal-sized buttons:
  - **Coinbase Pay**: Blue gradient with credit card icon
  - **CubePay**: Green gradient with lock emoji 🔒
- Hover effects with scale animation and colored shadows
- Icon indicators: `ExternalLink` for Coinbase, `ArrowRight` for CubePay
- Back button to return to wallet creation

### Button Styling

```jsx
// Coinbase Pay - Blue
className =
  "bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-blue-500 hover:from-blue-500 hover:to-blue-600";

// CubePay - Green
className =
  "bg-gradient-to-r from-green-600 to-emerald-500 hover:from-green-500 hover:to-emerald-600";
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Page

- URL: `http://localhost:5177/test-crypto-onboarding`
- Complete isolated test environment
- Mock agent with 3 USDC fee
- Both payment paths fully functional

### Test Scenarios

1. ✅ **Coinbase Pay Path**
   - Create wallet → Choose Coinbase → Complete purchase → Return to AR
2. ✅ **CubePay Path**
   - Create wallet → Choose CubePay → Opens terminal → Return to AR
3. ✅ **Error Recovery**
   - If Coinbase API fails → Still shows choice screen with CubePay option
4. ✅ **Back Navigation**
   - Can go back from choice screen to wallet creation

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Import Errors Are Silent in React**

   - Missing `ArrowRight` caused blank screen
   - Always check browser console for undefined variables

2. **Payment Choice Should Come First**

   - Originally tried adding button inside Coinbase iframe
   - CORS security prevents third-party UI injection
   - Solution: Show choice BEFORE launching external flows

3. **Error States Need Options**
   - Don't show broken UI when API fails
   - Always provide fallback path (CubePay)
   - User should never be stuck

## 🌟 Success Metrics

- ✅ **Black Screen Fixed**: ArrowRight import added
- ✅ **Choice Screen Working**: Both buttons visible and functional
- ✅ **Coinbase Flow Tested**: Payment popup opens correctly
- ✅ **CubePay Integration**: Flag detected in AR viewer
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Clean commits with good messages
- ✅ **Documentation**: This comprehensive summary created
