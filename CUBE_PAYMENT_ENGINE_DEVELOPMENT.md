Revolutionary 3D floating payment cube interface that replaces traditional payment modals in the AR viewer application. The cube floats in 3D space with interactive faces representing different payment methods.

## Current Status

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**  
**Last Updated**: August 28, 2025  
**Version**: 3.0

## Core Features Implemented

### üéØ 3D Cube Mechanics

- **Floating 3D Cube**: Positioned at `[0, 0, -3]` in 3D space
- **Interactive Rotation**: Mouse/touch drag controls with momentum
- **Auto-rotation**: Gentle rotation when not being manipulated
- **6 Faces**: Each face represents a different payment method
- **Face Detection**: Automatically detects which face is most visible to camera

### üí≥ Payment Methods (All 6 Faces)

1. **üì± Crypto QR** - Cryptocurrency QR code payments
2. **üí≥ Virtual Card** - Apple Pay / Google Pay integration
3. **üè¶ Bank QR** - Traditional bank transfer QR codes
4. **üîä Voice Pay** - Voice-activated payment processing
5. **üéµ Sound Pay** - Audio-based payment method
6. **üöÄ On / Off Ramp - Onboard User / Merchant** - Crypto onboarding system (multi-line display)

### üé® Visual Design

- **Face Colors**: Each payment method has unique color coding
- **Text Rendering**: React Three Fiber Text components with outlines
- **Multi-line Text**: Automatic line wrapping for long payment method names

## Development History

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation

- ‚úÖ Basic 3D cube with single face
- ‚úÖ React Three Fiber integration
- ‚úÖ Mouse interaction controls

### Phase 2: Multi-Face Development

- ‚úÖ 6-face cube geometry
- ‚úÖ Individual payment method configurations
- ‚úÖ Face rotation and positioning system

### Phase 3: Text Visibility Fixes

- ‚ùå **Issue**: White text on green background was invisible
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Changed to black text with white outlines
- ‚úÖ **Text Positioning**: Added textOffsets to float text 0.1 units in front of faces

### Phase 4: Layout Improvements

- ‚ùå **Issue**: Text positioning too far left, overlapping cube
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Adjusted positioning from X=0 to X=2 for better centering
- ‚úÖ **Spacing**: Moved "$15 USD" from Y=-2.5 to Y=-3.5 to avoid cube overlap

### Phase 5: Payment Methods Expansion

- ‚úÖ All 6 payment methods configured and visible
- ‚úÖ Fixed database override issue (now uses passed enabledMethods prop)
- ‚úÖ Added "Tap To Select" text on all faces
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Multi-line text rendering for long payment method names

### Phase 6: Text Wrapping & Layout Finalization

- ‚ùå **Issue**: "On / Off Ramp - Onboard User / Merchant" text extended beyond cube boundaries
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Implemented intelligent text wrapping
  - Text longer than 15 characters automatically splits into 2 lines
  - Splits on ' - ' delimiter for natural line breaks
  - Smaller font size (0.15) for multi-line text to fit properly
  - Upper line positioned at `textPosition[1] + 0.1`
  - Lower line positioned at `textPosition[1] - 0.1`

### Phase 7: Full 360¬∞ Rotation Freedom

- ‚ùå **Issue**: Vertical rotation limited to ¬±45¬∞ preventing access to top/bottom faces
  - Bank QR (top face) and Voice Pay (bottom face) couldn't be viewed straight-on
  - Rotation constraints: `Math.max(-Math.PI/4, Math.min(Math.PI/4, rotation.x))`
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Removed all rotation limits for full 360¬∞ freedom
  - Eliminated X-axis rotation constraints in both mouse and touch handlers
  - Users can now rotate cube completely up/down to view all 6 faces perfectly
  - Top face (Bank QR) and bottom face (Voice Pay) now fully accessible

### Phase 8: Text Overlap & Spacing Optimization

- ‚ùå **Issues**: Text overlap problems when viewing faces straight-on
  - Bank QR missing "Tap To Select" text completely
  - Voice Pay icon overlapping with method name
  - Text elements too close together causing visibility issues
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Optimized text spacing and positioning
  - **Icon Position**: Moved from `+0.3` to `+0.4` (higher up)
  - **Icon Size**: Reduced from `0.4` to `0.35` to prevent overlap
  - **Method Name**: Adjusted single-line position from `0` to `-0.05`
  - **Multi-line Text**: Better spacing (`+0.05` and `-0.15` instead of `+0.1` and `-0.1`)
  - **Tap To Select**: Moved from `-0.3` to `-0.4` (lower down)
  - **Font Sizes**: Optimized for better readability (0.16 for single-line, 0.13 for multi-line)

### Phase 9: Final Text Spacing & Conditional Instructions

- ‚ùå **Remaining Issues**: Voice Pay still overlapping, Bank QR needs "Tap To Scan"
  - Voice Pay icon and text still too close when viewed straight-on
  - Bank QR should show "Tap To Scan" instead of generic "Tap To Select"
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Enhanced spacing and conditional text
  - **Icon Position**: Further increased from `+0.4` to `+0.5` (maximum separation)
  - **Icon Size**: Reduced from `0.35` to `0.3` for cleaner look
  - **Method Names**: Single-line moved to `+0.05` (centered between icon and action)
  - **Action Text**: Moved to `-0.5` (maximum distance from method name)
  - **Conditional Instructions**: QR methods show "Tap To Scan", others show "Tap To Select"
  - **Font Optimization**: Reduced sizes for better spacing (0.14 single-line, 0.12 multi-line, 0.075 action)

### Phase 10: Maximum Spacing Implementation

- ‚ùå **Persistent Issues**: Voice Pay overlap and Bank QR text still not showing correctly
  - Despite previous fixes, text elements still too close together
  - Conditional logic working but text may not be rendering properly
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Extreme spacing with reduced font sizes
  - **Icon Position**: Increased to `+0.6` (maximum possible height)
  - **Icon Size**: Reduced to `0.25` for minimal footprint
  - **Method Names**: Single-line at `+0.1`, multi-line at `+0.15/-0.05`
  - **Action Text**: Moved to `-0.6` (extreme bottom position)
  - **Font Sizes**: Minimal for maximum spacing (0.13 single-line, 0.11 multi-line, 0.07 action)
  - **Verified Logic**: `method.includes('qr')` correctly identifies Bank QR and Crypto QR methods
